 *Intro
   This project is based on le OOC book which presents some tecnique to
   give to a c-program an oriented object structure. At the begining the lib
   will hold only the two root-Class named Object and Class. I have made this project
   in order to not get bored in the copy and past operations of source code.
   Other explanations will follow.
